* JavaScript is TypeScript. This means that any valid **.js** file can be renamed to <b>.ts</b> and compiled with other TypeScript files.
* TypeScript supports Object Oriented Programming concepts like <b>classes</b>, <b>interfaces</b>, <b>inheritance</b>, etc.

### Difference between ES6 (ES2015) and Typescript
> There is no difference in both of them. Everything you write in ES6 is supported by Typescript.
Typescript is an extension of ES6. `So whatever is valid JavaScript will be valid TypeScript so no other changes are needed`. Some features that are additionally included in Typescript are:

* Type Annotations
  * eg: 
    * name: string = 'SURESH'
    * age: number = '123';
* Interfaces
* Enums
* Mixins 

and many moreâ€¦
