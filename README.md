### Difference between ES6 (ES2015) and Typescript
> There is no difference in both of them. Everything you write in ES6 is supported by Typescript.
Typescript is an extension of ES6. Some features that are additionally included in Typescript are:

* Type Annotations
  * eg: 
    * name: string = 'SURESH'
    * age: number = '123';
* Interfaces
* Enums
* Mixins 

and many moreâ€¦
